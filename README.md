# Denver Shows

**Version 1.0.0**

Denver Shows is a website built for connecting music lovers in the Denver area with their favorite artists.
The goal of this project is to make the process of looking for exciting concerts easier by having the info for all
upcoming shows available in one place. Other websites like TicketMaster and LiveNation also have aggregate concert data,
however they do not always post every upcoming show due to licensing rights that only allow one company
to sell tickets for a certain venue. That can lead to people thinking that there no upcoming shows for certain venues,
when in reality there are upcoming shows. Denver Shows aims to reduce that confusion and better empower users to find concerts
that excite them.

Key features:
* View all upcoming Denver shows for well known venues 
* The Python web scrapers that collect show data for each page run every hour to ensure up to date information
* Buy tickets easily with the "Get Tickets" button for any upcoming show
